Privacy policy:
By adding this bot to your server you are consenting to let it view/manage messages and view user profile info such as (usernames and profile photos) in your discord server. This bot will check all messages for a URL with a broken embed. In this process the bot does not store or transmit any user data. If it finds a broken link in your message it will replace it with a webhook message featuring the original senders profile photo and username. At no point during this process does the bot save any of the user data it views to opperate. 

Furthermore, this bot only needs the permissions: manage webhhooks, send messages, send messages in threads, manage messages, manage threads, embed links, add reactions and the ability to read message history. Any bot invite link that uses the name, likeness or image of this bot and ask for more permissions (namely those relating to moderation) is likely disgenuine.

This bot is not a way to bypass moderation in servers. End users are responsible for the content of their embeds even when modified by the bot. THE DISCORD LINK EMBED BOT IS IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENT OF YOUR MESSAGES AND THEIR POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES. CONTENT YOU SEND IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. If you are a server moderator, be mindful of when the bot forwards an embed on behalf of a user with a broken link.
